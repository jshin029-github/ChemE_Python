# User Guide
Hello and welcome to _Python for Chemical Engineers_.

In this repository, you'll find Jupyter Notebooks going through an introduction to Python and related tools for applications in ChemE. You can follow along on github or download the .ipynb files to go through and run the code yourself! 

If you just want to follow along, go ahead and puruse through the files in this repo.

If you want to run the code, make sure you have Jupyter installed on your computer; if not, you can follow the installation guide below.

# Installation Guide
## Getting Python
Since this is a Python tutorial, you'll need to install it! You'll need Python 3 to get started. You can download Python directly <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> here</a>. Just follow the instructions for your own operating system.

## Installing Jupyter
This tutorial is all written in Jupyter Notebooks, so you'll need to install it to get started. The simplest way would be to follow the instructions <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html"> here</a>. Follow the instructions using `pip` since it comes installed with Python.

In Windows, you'll need to open either command prompt or a PowerShell window to carry out the instructions. To do so, hit the <kbd>Start</kbd> and search for <kbd>cmd</kbd> or <kbd>Windows PowerShell</kbd>.

In Mac/Linux, just go to <kbd>Terminal </kbd> to carry out the instructions.

## Running Jupyter
Now that everything's all set, follow the instructions <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running">here</a> to get started.

For Windows, just go to your desired workspace directory (a file folder) and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>right click </kbd> and click <kbd>Open PowerShell Window Here</kbd> for the command line. 

For Mac/Linux, just run the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> in your desired workspace.

## Using Anaconda
If you don't want to deal with all of this PowerShell/Terminal nonsense, you can use Anaconda. You'll find installation instructions <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/"> here</a> for your own operating system. Once you've got it installed, just run Anaconda and you'll be able to run Jupyter Notebooks (note: I've found that Anaconda is much more CPU-intensive than just using the command prompt).

Alternatively, you can just use Anaconda as a Python management tool: just install it, and then follow the above instructions using `conda` instead of `pip`.

# Next Steps
That's it! Now that you have Python installed, just open up the command prompt and run ```jupyter notebook 1_Basic_Python_Intro.ipynb``` and be well on your way!
